# Markov Chain Application Analysis

This repository contains an updated version of the code in order to reproduce the experiments reported in "Data mining in the development of mHealth apps: assessing in-app navigation through Markov Chain analysis". All code has been ported to pure JavaScript such that all steps in the pipeline can now be performed in your browser.

In order to try out the demo, download an example file (such as the [start2cycle data](start2cycle.csv)) and go to [the demo website](https://ibcnservices.github.io/MCAppAnalysis/)
